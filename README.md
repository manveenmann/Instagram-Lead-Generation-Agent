# 📸 Instagram Lead Generation Agent with n8n + Apify + Airtable

> A no-code automation workflow using **n8n**, **Apify**, and **Airtable** to extract Instagram leads based on a search query — ideal for marketers, agencies, and outreach campaigns.
---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Finding potential leads on Instagram manually is slow, repetitive, and inefficient. You either spend hours scrolling or pay for expensive third-party tools.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

This agent automates lead generation from Instagram using public data and APIs — without writing a single line of backend code.

### 🧩 Here's how it works:
1. Accepts a **search keyword** (e.g., "fitness coach India")
2. Sends it to **Apify**’s Instagram Scraper
3. Waits for the scraper to finish the job
4. Cleans and extracts relevant fields like:
   - Username  
   - Instagram Handle 
   - Follower Count  
   - Bio
5. Pushes this data directly to an **Airtable sheet** for further use (like cold outreach or enrichment)
